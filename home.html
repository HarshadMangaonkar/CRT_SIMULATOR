        <h3>About the project</h3>
        <p>A Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) oscilloscope helps students understand signal visualization, electron emission, focusing, and deflection. Since real CRTs are outdated, fragile, and rarely available, students often learn only the theory. A Virtual CRT Oscilloscope Simulator visually demonstrates beam movement, deflection, and waveform formation using web technologies, making learning interactive, safe, and easier without real hardware.</p>
